# Stereo Disparity Estimation

- based on Stereo Disparity Estimation using Stereo Hybrid Event-Frame Cameras (SHEF)

- a project report on event-based robot vision by Nan Cai, supervised by Prof. Dr. Guillermo Gallego. 
- The report explores the use of event cameras for disparity estimation and 3D perception, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, 3D reconstruction, and virtual reality.
